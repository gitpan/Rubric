<h2>milestones</h2>
<h3>0.06</h3>
<ul>
	<li>bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<h3>0.05</h3>
<ul>
	<li>regression testing
	<p>
		Regression tests will be written.  (Current coverage is around 30%, and
		that's largely due to POD coveage.)
	</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>0.04</h3>
<ul>
	<li>automatic user creation
		<p>
			It should be possible to create users automatically upon login attempt.
			When coupled with HTTP authorization, this should allow intranet users to
			begin using a local Rubric seamlessly.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>refactored EntriesQuery
		<p>
			Rubric::WebApp::EntriesQuery should only parse URIs and send result sets
			to the pager.  (A renaming may be in order, too.)  Another module should
			take natural parameters and produce result sets.  It should be able to
			return errors on invalid queries and empty sets.  (Future revisions
			should turn a query into English for display on error or as a title.)
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>display user's tags on his post form</li>
	<li>a clearer notice on empty result sets</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h3>0.03</h3>
<ul>
	<li>subclassable login
		<p>
			Rubric now includes a class (Rubric::WebApp::Login) that defines logic
			for accepting logins; subclasses for login via HTTP and via posted form
			data are also included.  This change should make intranet Rubrics easier
			to implement.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>new query builder and /entries handler
		<p>
			There was an 0.03 milestone to allow querying by date and time ranges.
			To implement this, a new query builder was written to replace
			Rubric::Entry-&gt;by_tag.  Right now it's got its web bits and SQL bits
			all intertwined, but that will be fixed.  The /user and /tag run modes
			were eliminated as such.
	</li>

	<li>fatals to browser
		<p>Rubric now sends fatal error messages to the end user.  This won't
		persist forever, but it will continue until Rubric is more mature and less
		likely to fail during normal use.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>0.02</h3>
<p>Release 0.02 fixed a HTTP header bug.</p>

<h3>0.01</h3>
<ul>
	<li>a new database can be built</li>

	<li>an old database can always be upgraded</li>

	<li>new users can register accounts
		<p>New accounts are verified via email.  Registration can be disabled.</p>
	</li>

	<li>users can change their email apress and password</li>

	<li>users can create, delete, and edit their entries
		<p>
			Entries have a title and tags.  They might have a link, description, and
			a long text body.  A user only has one entry per link.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>users can copy the entries of other users</li>

	<li>entries can be queried by user or tag
		<p>
			Anyone can search for entries based on the user who created them or the
			assigned tags.
		</p>
	</li>

	<li>search results are available via rss
		<p>
			Any search that can be performed via the normal HTML interface can be
			retrieved as RSS.  The RSS links are announced on the HTML results.
		</p>
	</li>
	</ul>
