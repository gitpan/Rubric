  Rubric can store and organize your bookmarks for you, filling in for your
  browser's bookmarks feature.  Since you won't be using "Add Bookmark"
  anymore, you'll need a new, convenient way to bookmark pages.  Bookmarklets
  like these will help:
</p>

[% IF current_user %]
<p class='bookmarklet'>
  <a href='[% uri.entries(user => current_user) %]'>my rubric</a>
</p>
[% END %]

<p class='bookmarklet'>
  <a href="javascript:location.href='[% uri.post_entry %]?uri='+escape(location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)+'&when_done=go_back'">
    post to rubric
  </a>
</p>

<p class='bookmarklet'>
  <a href="javascript:void(open('[% uri.post_entry %]?uri='+escape(location.href)+'&title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)+'&when_done=close','Rubric','toolbar=no,width=700,height=325,scrollbars'));">
    post to rubric
  </a> (pop up)
</p>

<p>
	You can drag them to your browser's bookmark bar (if it has one) or put them
	in its bookmark menu.
</p>

<p>
  The "post to rubric" link should be explained a bit.  It uses JavaScript to
  redirect you to this Rubric's posting link; this means you'll need to be
  logged in.  It passes a the URI and title of your current page to the form,
  and also a "when_done" parameter that, here, tells Rubric to send you back to
  the bookmarked page when you're done.
