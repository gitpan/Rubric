README for Rubric

Things you'll have to do to use it:

1. install the modules with the usual "make install"
2. put rubric.cgi and rubric.yml somewhere together in your docroot
3. put the templates somewhere
4. update rubric.yml
5. run the included makedb to generate rubric.db
6. put rubric.db somewhere
7. set rubric.db a+w; you may need its location to be 0777; not sure yet
8. create a user object for yourself
   you could just run the filldb script to get some bogus data, but... why?
9. get your bookmarks from delicious with my delicious-backup
   delbackup -y | load_yml USERNAME
A. go?

my bookmarklet:
	javascript:location.href='http://server.name.tld/rubric/post?uri='+escape(location.href)+'&title='+escape(document.title)
